      <p>
        Hello everyone!!! This is Poorvanshi Rawat, a kid who has is up to learn
        everything possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a student of B.Sc(C.S)Hons 1st year and also the CR of the
        class(one really hectic job) though i enjoy it as well. I like to keep
        people around me happy. I am so much into the weirdo behaviour that when
        I am normal once in a while, people around me ask if I am unwell.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a chatterbox around my people(they would explain better). I try to
        find happiness in even the most complicated situations to lighten up the
        mood of myself and people around me. I am a very positive approach
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very committed towards my work (even the smallest one). I like
        <span class="hobby">dancing</span>, <span class="hobby">singing</span>,
        <span class="hobby">playing casio</span>,
        <span class="hobby">listening to music</span>,
        <span class="hobby">mimicking others</span> (only for the people I know
        well).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I have a good leadership quality also, since I have been the
        school vice head girl and head girl in my 11th and 12th. I am a person
        anyone can rely on in any situation as I am very helpful and supportive
        in nature( to the extent that I even help the people who I don't like
        for any reason).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have this weird habit of never being able to get angry with anyone. I
        always keep relations before myself which can be wrong sometimes but
        this habit is unchangeable since its from my childhood.
      </p>

      <!-- Skills Highlight -->
      <div class="skills">
        ðŸ’» I am good in <span>Python</span>. <br />
        ðŸŽ¨ I am good with <span>Graphic Designing</span>. <br />
        ðŸŽ¥ I am good at <span>Video Editing</span> to some extent.
      </div>

      <p>
        Atlast, I would say that I am very mature in situations where I am
        supposed to be that way, otherwise I am a full time roaster and comedian
        for the people around me. I hope this journey in ACM adds more elements
        to my Intro.
